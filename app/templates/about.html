    <h1>About Tim</h1>
    <p class="page-subtitle">Instructional Designer · AI Strategist · Software Engineer</p>

    <p>With a unique blend of experience spanning education, technology, and AI, I bring a rare perspective to every project. I've spent 15 years in education leadership designing curriculum and learning experiences that drive measurable outcomes, and 8 years building enterprise software at Sprint and DST Systems.</p>

    <p>Today, I'm focused on bridging the gap between AI hype and real-world value — helping organizations build practical AI solutions that actually work. Whether it's designing a conversational agent, automating a workflow, or building a full-stack application, I bring the same commitment to clarity, quality, and impact.</p>

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>I believe the best solutions come from understanding the problem deeply before writing a single line of code. My background in instructional design — specifically Understanding by Design (UbD) — means I always start with the end in mind: What does success look like? What evidence will tell us we got there?</p>

    <p>This learner-centered, outcomes-driven mindset carries into everything I build.</p>
